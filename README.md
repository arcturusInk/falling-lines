# Falling Lines (https://youtu.be/04P3sSzXWXE)
Intersection of animated, falling straight lines

#### About: 
When I was coding my personal website/coding portfolio, my objective was to make it very minimal â€“ mostly black and white aesthetic. However, I felt that there would too much blank space, so to give the background some depth, I decided to intersect it with straight lines.

#### The Process: 
The final version of the script was coded with p5.js.

#### The First Iteration:

#### The Second Iteration:
This is where I started when I began to code the graphic/animation: http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/embed/SyzL29I_z.

#### The Third Iteration:
After that, I slowly figured out how to have multiple lines, instead of just one line. You can see animation [here](https://editor.p5js.org/full/Hk0n3qI_z).

#### The Fourth Iteration:
The fourth and final iteration of the script can be seen as the background of my coding-portfolio site. You can see the demo [here](https://youtu.be/04P3sSzXWXE).
